# minitalk
A project exploring unix signals.

This project was made as part of my studies at Hive Helsinki.
To compile, run 'make'. The Makefile will create two executables,
server and client. Run server first, and copy it's process ID which will
be displayed in the terminal. Then, it is possible to run client and,
using the process ID, send a string to be printed by server.
